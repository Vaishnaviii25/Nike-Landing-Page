# Nike Landing Page with Tailwind CSS
This repository showcases a modern and stylish landing page design influenced by Nike's branding and aesthetics. Developed by Vaishnaviii25, this project demonstrates the utilization of Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to streamline the styling process and enhance development efficiency.

# Features:
- Tailwind CSS Integration: The landing page design leverages the power of Tailwind CSS, allowing for rapid prototyping and flexible styling through utility classes.

- Responsive Design: The page is meticulously crafted to be fully responsive, ensuring seamless user experiences across various devices and screen sizes.

- Nike-Inspired Visuals: Drawing inspiration from Nike's design language, the page incorporates bold typography, vibrant colors, and high-quality imagery to capture the essence of the brand.

- Interactive Elements: Incorporation of interactive elements, facilitated by Tailwind CSS classes or potentially JavaScript, enhances user engagement and adds dynamism to the page.
